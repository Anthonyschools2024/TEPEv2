Ticket Evolution Public Events (T.E.P.E.)Developer: AnthonyStatus: Pre-Production (70% Complete)Theme: Native American Culture & Earth Tones🦅 Project OverviewT.E.P.E. is a comprehensive event management and ticketing platform designed to connect communities through live events. It is a full-stack web application built to handle the entire lifecycle of an event—from an organizer publishing a show to a fan scanning their ticket at the door.This project is a modern evolution of my original "Ticket Evolution" concept, rebuilt from the ground up with a focus on cultural identity, seamless user experience, and robust real-time data handling.🛠️ Technology StackI built T.E.P.E. using a serverless architecture to ensure scalability and ease of deployment.FrontendHTML5: Semantic structure for all portals.Tailwind CSS: Utilized via CDN for rapid UI development. I configured a custom color palette (earth-brown, earth-green, earth-blue) to strictly adhere to the Native American earth-tone theme.JavaScript (ES6+): Vanilla JS with ES Modules (type="module") to handle all application logic, DOM manipulation, and state management without the overhead of a heavy framework.Backend & Database (Serverless)Google Firebase:Firestore (Native Mode): A NoSQL cloud database used to store events, tickets, and user data in real-time.Firebase Authentication: Handles secure sign-up and login sessions for both Organizers and Fans, ensuring data isolation between accounts.Integrations & APIsPayPal JavaScript SDK: Integrated for secure payment processing. Includes dynamic total calculation, tax/discount logic, and a fallback "Test Mode" for development safety.HTML5-QRCode: A library integrated into the Organizer Portal to access the device camera and scan attendee QR codes for check-in verification.QR Server API: Used to dynamically generate unique QR codes for purchased tickets based on the secure Customer ID.Phosphor Icons: A flexible icon family used for the UI elements.📱 Application ModulesThe system is divided into three distinct applications:1. Public Landing Page (index.html)The customer-facing portal where fans discover and purchase tickets.Hero Carousel: Automated image slider with earth-tone gradient overlays.Real-Time Event Grid: Fetches events instantly from Firestore.Interactive Calendar: A custom-built JS calendar that maps events to specific dates.Ticketing Modal: A full e-commerce flow allowing users to select Ticket Tiers (VIP vs GA) and Quantity.Digital Wallet: A "My Tickets" section where logged-in fans can view and download their purchased QR codes.2. Organizer Portal (organizer.html)The command center for event creators.Secure Dashboard: Data is strictly filtered so organizers only see their own events.Event Creation Suite: Advanced form to publish events with:Custom Ticket Tiers (Price & Capacity).Financial Tools (Tax Rates & Promo Codes).Image Upload Handling (Base64 conversion).Analytics Tab: Real-time data visualization showing Gross Revenue, Tickets Sold, and Transaction History.Check-In Scanner: A built-in QR code reader that verifies tickets against the database and marks them as "Used" to prevent fraud.3. Super Admin Portal (admin.html)A master view restricted to the platform owner.Global Oversight: View total revenue and ticket counts across all organizers.User Management: detailed lists of all Organizers and Fans in the system.Moderation: Ability to delete any event on the platform.⚙️ Configuration & SetupTo run this project locally:Files: Ensure index.html, organizer.html, and admin.html are in the same directory.Images: The folder must contain the local assets: tepe01.jpg through tepe05.jpg.Server: Due to CORS policies with ES Modules and the Camera API, this must be run on a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code or python -m http.server).Note: The Camera Scanner requires localhost or HTTPS to function.CredentialsFirebase Project: tepe-v2 (Firestore Native Mode).PayPal Client ID: Live credentials configured for NO_SHIPPING flow.🚀 Future Roadmap (Production Phase)We are approximately 70% complete. The following tasks remain for the final production launch:[ ] Domain Deployment: Hosting the HTML files on Firebase Hosting or Vercel.[ ] Secure Email Service: Replacing the frontend email simulation with a real backend service (e.g., SendGrid or EmailJS) to actually email tickets to customers.[ ] Storage Buckets: Migrating image uploads from Base64 strings (database-heavy) to Firebase Storage buckets.[ ] Role-Based Security Rules: Finalizing Firestore security rules to strictly enforce Organizer vs. Fan data permissions on the server side.This project represents a major milestone in my development journey, combining complex integrations into a seamless, culturally thematic user experience.Ticket Evolution Public Events (T.E.P.E.)Developer: AnthonyStatus: Pre-Production (70% Complete)Theme: Native American Culture & Earth Tones🦅 Project OverviewT.E.P.E. is a comprehensive event management and ticketing platform designed to connect communities through live events.
